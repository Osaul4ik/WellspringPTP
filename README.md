# WellspringPTP

**Windows Precision Touchpad kernel driver for Apple MacBooks**

WellspringPTP is a Windows Precision Touchpad driver focused on delivering a native, responsive, and reliable experience on Apple MacBooks.

The project started as a fork of **mac-precision-touchpad** and has since evolved into a significantly reworked implementation.

---

# Current Status

Stable 

The driver has been extensively tested on **MacBook Pro 16,1 (2019) and Air 2015**

**Haptic feedback is not currently implemented. The Force Touch trackpad's actuator requires a calibration sequence to drive properly, and that process hasn't been reverse-engineered yet — so this feature is blocked until that's figured out.**

> **Recommended:** Set the Windows pointer speed to **8**.

# Features

* Windows Precision Touchpad support
* Native multi-touch gestures (pinch, zoom, scroll, swipe)
* Smoother, more accurate finger tracking — fewer dropped or mismatched contacts
* No more cursor jumps or "ghost" touches
* Palm rejection
* Fixed handling of malformed/overflow USB packets
* Force Touch triggers the right-click context menu
* Low-latency input processing

---

# Known Limitations

- Requires Windows Test Mode.
- Haptic feedback is not implemented.
- Only USB Apple trackpads are supported.

# Supported Devices

### Fully supported

* Apple MacBook Pro 16,1 (2019, T2)
* MacBook Air 2015 13" (7,2)

### Expected to work (not yet tested)

MacBook Pro:
- MacBook Pro 2015 13" (12,1) — Force Touch, no Touch Bar
- MacBook Pro 2018 15" (15,1)
- MacBook Pro 2018 13", 4× TB3 (15,2)
- MacBook Pro 2019 15" (15,3) — shares the same trackpad/PID as 15,1
- MacBook Pro 2019 13", 2× TB3 (15,4)
- MacBook Pro 2019 16" (16,1)
- MacBook Pro 2020 13", 4× TB3 (16,2)
- MacBook Pro 2020 13", 2× TB3 (16,3)
- MacBook Pro 2020 16" (16,4) — shares the same trackpad/PID as 16,1

MacBook Air:
- MacBook Air 2013 11" (6,1)
- MacBook Air 2013 13" (6,2)
- MacBook Air 2015 11" (7,1) — shares the same trackpad/PID as 6,1
- MacBook Air 2018 (8,1)
- MacBook Air 2019 (8,2) — shares the same trackpad/PID as 8,1 (not verified on real hardware)
- MacBook Air 2020 (9,1)

### Partial

MacBookPro13,x / 14,x (2016-2017, Touch Bar, T1) — PID 0277. Falls back to an imprecise generic entry

### Other MacBooks SPI
